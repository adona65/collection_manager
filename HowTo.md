## Application informations
#### Launch the application (for Windows)
- With command prompt, go to project's folder.
- Use <span style="color: green;">*mvnw spring-boot:run*</span>. This will launch the back-end Spring boot's part. It will listen by default on Spring Boot's port "8080".

- With a second command prompt, go to project's folder/front.
- Use <span style="color: green;">*ng serve --o*</span>. This will launch the front-end Angular's part (and open a browser on application's home page). It will listen by default on Angular's port "4200" : <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a>

#### Hot build application during developments and debugging
- Spring boot's hot build is managed by a dependency added to maven configuration (in pom.xml file) : org.springframework.boot.spring-boot-devtools

- Angular's hot build is automatically done thanks to <span style="color: green;">*ng serve --o*</span> command we used for launching front-end part.

For debugging Angular part, watch <a href="https://angular.io/guide/devtools">Angular's devtool guide</a>. 

#### Conveniently launch application for developments (for Windows)
Launch <span style="color: green;">*app-launch-dev.bat*</span> script stored inside project's root directory. It will open two command prompt, each executing launch of either front-end or back-end part of application. One will contain logs from Sprint boot, the other from Angular.

#### Working with SQLite
SQLite was chosen because it's a lite-easy-to-use database provider. The fastest way to create an SQLite's database is to use the SQLite Studio tool.
